# Construction-site-acciedent-analysis
Leveraged ML, NLP, and data analysis to extract insights from accident reports, offering actionable safety recommendations for construction sites.

In this project, construction site accidents are analysed through text mining and NLP techniques and prevent further accidents in the construction site.

# Problem statement

The aim is to enhance safety measures and minimize the occurrence of accidents. By analyzing textual data such as accident reports, incident narratives, and safety records, valuable insights can be gained regarding the causes, patterns, and trends of accidents. This information can then be used to identify potential hazards, develop proactive safety strategies, and implement preventive measures to mitigate risks. Ultimately, the project seeks to create a safer work environment for construction workers and reduce the occurrence of accidents, leading to improved safety outcomes and enhanced overall construction site management.

# Objective

By analyzing the textual data and applying NLP techniques, the project aims to identify the root causes of construction site accidents. This involves examining the accident reports, incident narratives, and safety records to uncover the contributing factors, such as human error, equipment malfunction, inadequate training, or insufficient safety protocols. By understanding the underlying causes, the project can provide valuable insights into areas that require improvement and help stakeholders implement effective preventive measures. The findings can be used to enhance safety training programs, revise safety guidelines, and implement risk mitigation strategies. Ultimately, the objective is to reduce the occurrence of construction site accidents by addressing the root causes and creating a safer work environment for construction workers.
